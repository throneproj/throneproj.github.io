In TUN mode, Throne creates a virtual network adapter and sends the traffic of the whole computer through it. This covers apps that ignore proxy settings, and DNS queries too. Use it when the system proxy is not enough. For a comparison of both modes, see [Which mode to use](@/guides/proxy_modes.md#which-mode).

## Turn on TUN mode {#enable}

1. Tick `Tun Mode` on the main window, or use `Operation Mode` → `Tun Mode` in the tray menu.
2. The first time, Throne asks for the rights that TUN needs. Accept the request (see below).
3. Start a profile, if none is running.

While TUN mode is active, the window title shows `[Tun]`. It starts with `[Admin]` when Throne has the rights for TUN. Turning TUN mode on or off restarts the running profile.

TUN mode works only while a profile runs. When you stop the profile, your apps use your normal connection again. Throne has no kill switch; see [FAQ](@/help/faq.md#kill-switch). With `Program` → `Remember last profile` on, Throne starts the last profile again when it starts, and turns TUN mode back on if it was on when you quit.

What happens the first time:

- **Windows:** Throne asks "Please run Throne as admin". Click `Yes`. Throne closes and starts again as administrator, with TUN mode on; Windows shows a user account control prompt first. Windows Firewall may then ask about `ThroneCore`. Allow it: if you block it, TUN connects, but nothing loads.
- **Linux:** Throne asks "Please give the core root privileges". Click `Yes` and enter your password in the system prompt. Throne then gives the core root rights. Tick `Tun Mode` again.
- **macOS:** Throne asks "Please give the core root privileges". Click `Yes`. Terminal opens and runs a `sudo` command. Enter your password in Terminal, then tick `Tun Mode` again.

## Privileges {#privileges}

TUN mode needs system rights to create the adapter and change the routes of the computer.

### Windows {#privileges-windows}

- Throne must run as administrator. The first click on `Tun Mode` offers a restart as administrator.
- After Throne has run as administrator once, it asks for administrator rights each time it starts. To stop this, tick `Settings` → `Basic Settings` → `Security` → `Always Start as Standard User`. Throne then asks again each time you turn on TUN mode.
- If you turn on `Program` → `Start with system` while Throne runs as administrator, Throne starts with administrator rights at sign-in, without a prompt.

See also [FAQ](@/help/faq.md#tun-admin).

### Linux {#privileges-linux}

- Only the core, `ThroneCore`, needs root rights. Throne gives it these rights with `pkexec`: it makes root the owner of `ThroneCore` and sets the SUID bit (`chown root:root` and `chmod u+s`).
- `pkexec` is part of polkit. If it is missing, Throne shows "Please install "pkexec" first."
- Never start Throne itself with `sudo`.
- Instead of the SUID bit, you can give the core these five capabilities: `CAP_NET_ADMIN`, `CAP_NET_RAW`, `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE`, `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` and `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`. Throne accepts the core as privileged only if it has all five.

```bash
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw,cap_net_bind_service,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_dac_read_search+ep /path/to/Throne/ThroneCore
```

Some third-party packages cannot change the core themselves. They show "This installation cannot grant the core privileges by itself." together with instructions from the package. See also [FAQ](@/help/faq.md#linux-suid).

### macOS {#privileges-macos}

- Move `Throne.app` to `/Applications` before you turn on TUN mode. The rights are set from Terminal, and this can fail while the app is in `Downloads`.
- Throne opens Terminal with a `sudo chown root:wheel … && sudo chmod u+s …` command for the core. Enter your password there, then tick `Tun Mode` again.
- `sudo` needs an administrator account. On a standard account you can use the system proxy, but not TUN mode.

### Turn off the requests {#disable-privilege-request}

`Settings` → `Basic Settings` → `Security` → `Disable Privilege request` stops Throne from asking for rights. Throne then starts TUN mode with the rights it has, and the log says "User opted for no privilege req, some features may not work". Use this only if you give the rights yourself, for example when you always start Throne as administrator, or when you set the capabilities shown above.

## TUN settings {#settings}

Open `Settings` → `Tun Settings`. If TUN mode is on when you click `OK`, Throne shows "Restart Tun to take effect". Turn `Tun Mode` off and on again.

| Setting | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Stack` | `system` on Windows 10 and later and on Linux, `gvisor` on macOS | How the core processes the adapter's traffic. `system` uses the network stack of the operating system, `gvisor` a network stack inside the core, and `mixed` uses `system` for TCP and `gvisor` for UDP. On Windows 7 and 8 it is always `gvisor`. |
| `MTU` | `1500` | The largest packet size of the adapter. Choose `1500` or `9000`, or type a value from 1000 to 10000. Other values are replaced with 9000. |
| `Tun Enable IPv6` | off | Gives the adapter an IPv6 address, so that IPv6 traffic goes through the tunnel. |
| `Strict Route` | on for Windows 10 and later, off elsewhere | On Windows, blocks DNS queries that try to go around the tunnel. See [Windows DNS Leak Protection](@/advanced/windows_tun_mode.md#strict-route). |
| `Enable Tun Routing` | off | Leaves the IP ranges and `geoip-*` rule-sets that your routing sends `direct` out of the tunnel, so the system routes them past the core. Large rule-sets can cause very high CPU use on Windows. |
| `Auto Redirect` | on | Linux only. Needed on newer kernels for the `system` and `mixed` stacks. While it is on, this computer cannot be used as a network gateway for other devices. |
| `L3 Bridge Bypass` | off | Sends UDP and ICMP traffic that your rules send `direct` straight out of the network adapter, instead of opening a new connection for it. This is faster and keeps NAT working for games and P2P. TCP keeps the normal direct path. Not available on Windows on ARM. |
| `IPv4 CIDR` | `172.19.0.1/24` | The IPv4 address of the adapter. Change it only if it clashes with a network you use. `Restore default addresses` resets both addresses. |
| `IPv6 CIDR` | `fdfe:dcba:9876::1/96` | The IPv6 address of the adapter. Used only with `Tun Enable IPv6`. |
| `Private Range Bypass` | on | Address ranges that go straight to your network adapter instead of through the core, one per line. `Restore default ranges` restores the list. Loopback and broadcast addresses always bypass the tunnel. |
| `Troubleshooting` → `Reset` | – | Restarts the core process. Use it when TUN mode does not start. |

The default `Private Range Bypass` list is `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `169.254.0.0/16`, `224.0.0.0/4`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10` and `ff00::/8`.

## Side effects {#side-effects}

### Local network {#side-effects-lan}

With `Private Range Bypass` on, your computer reaches printers, network drives, your router's settings page and other local devices directly, outside the tunnel. If you turn it off, local traffic goes through the core, and your routing rules decide where it goes. A routing rule that sends a private range to the proxy, or blocks it, keeps that range in the tunnel so that the rule works.

### Mobile hotspot and connection sharing on Windows {#side-effects-hotspot}

If Windows Mobile Hotspot or Internet Connection Sharing shares your normal network adapter, Windows ignores the settings that keep Throne's own connections out of the tunnel. TUN mode then fails, and Throne warns "IPv4 forwarding breaks Tun mode". Share the hotspot from the `throne-tun` adapter instead: in the Windows settings for Mobile hotspot, set "Share my internet connection from" to `throne-tun`. Or turn the hotspot off while you use TUN mode. See [Recipes](@/guides/recipes.md#hotspot).

### Docker, WSL and virtual machines {#side-effects-vms}

Containers and virtual machines have their own virtual networks. Traffic between them and your computer uses private addresses, so it usually bypasses the tunnel. If such a network uses a range that is not in the `Private Range Bypass` list, add it. On Linux, remember that `Auto Redirect` stops the computer from working as a network gateway. See [Recipes](@/guides/recipes.md#docker-wsl-vms).

### Other VPNs {#side-effects-vpn}

Two VPNs on the same computer compete for routes and DNS. Turn off other VPN apps while TUN mode is on. To reach a company network at the same time, see [Recipes](@/guides/recipes.md#corporate-vpn).

### IPv6 {#side-effects-ipv6}

`Tun Enable IPv6` is off by default. Turn it on only if your server supports IPv6. Otherwise, you can get connection problems.

### DNS {#side-effects-dns}

In TUN mode, the DNS queries of all apps reach Throne. A DNS leak test can still show the DNS server of your Internet provider for sites that your rules send direct. This is expected; see [DNS](@/guides/dns.md#leak-tests).

## Troubleshooting {#troubleshooting}

Open the `Logs` tab and look for errors when TUN mode starts. For general steps, see [Troubleshooting](@/help/troubleshooting.md#tun).

### Windows {#troubleshooting-windows}

**Connected, but nothing loads.** Windows Firewall may block `ThroneCore`. Windows asks only once, when you first turn on TUN mode. If you blocked it then, allow `ThroneCore` in `Windows Security` → `Firewall & network protection` → `Allow an app through firewall`, for private and public networks.

**Antivirus.** Some antivirus programs, for example Avast and ESET, block the adapter or the core. Add an exception for the Throne folder.

**Another stack.** Set `Stack` to `gvisor` in `Tun Settings` and try again.

**"Strict routing unavailable".** Windows could not turn on strict routing. Untick `Strict Route` in `Tun Settings` and start the profile again. Without it, DNS queries can leak; see [Windows DNS Leak Protection](@/advanced/windows_tun_mode.md).

**"Tun device misbehaving".** Click `Reset` to restart the core, then start the profile again.

**After a crash or force-quit.** The virtual adapter can be left behind. Restart Windows.

**TUN mode takes very long to start.** Throne clears the DNS cache of Windows when TUN mode starts. A very large HOSTS file, for example an ad-blocking list with 100,000 entries, makes this very slow. Make the HOSTS file smaller.

**Mobile hotspot.** See [Mobile hotspot and connection sharing](#side-effects-hotspot).

### Linux {#troubleshooting-linux}

**"Please install "pkexec" first."** Install polkit with your package manager, or set the capabilities shown in [Linux privileges](#privileges-linux).

**"file exists" when TUN mode starts.** This error came from `Auto Redirect` and was fixed in 1.2.2. If you still see it, turn off `Auto Redirect` and set `Stack` to `gvisor`.

**No DNS with systemd-resolved.** If `DNSOverTLS` is turned on for all interfaces in `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`, TUN mode breaks. Turn it off there, or turn it off for the Throne adapter while the adapter exists:

```bash
sudo resolvectl dnsovertls throne-tun no
```

**Packages from AUR, Nix or other repositories.** They are maintained by the community. If TUN mode fails there, try the official build; see [FAQ](@/help/faq.md#third-party-packages).

**Throne was started with `sudo`.** Quit it and start it as your normal user. Only the core needs root.

### macOS {#troubleshooting-macos}

**macOS says that the app is damaged or cannot be opened.** Remove the quarantine flag:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/Throne.app
```

**The rights request fails.** Move `Throne.app` to `/Applications`, start it from there, and tick `Tun Mode` again.

**Standard account.** TUN mode needs an administrator account. Use the system proxy, or sign in with an administrator account.

## On Android {#android}

In `VPN` mode, Throne for Android works like TUN mode. Its settings are in `Settings` → `TUN / VPN`. There, the default stack is gVisor, the default MTU is 9000, and strict route is always on. See [VPN & Proxy Modes](@/android/modes.md#tun-settings).
